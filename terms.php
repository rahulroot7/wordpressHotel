                  <p>Because Travel Agent is not the agent of any airline, rental car company, cruise line, and/or hotel, Travel Agent cannot, and does not guarantee the accuracy of rates indicated on Travel Agent Site. Travel Agent uses best efforts as your agent to determine the appropriate rates for any rental car company, restaurant, and/or hotel you select, but these are intended merely as guidelines and not as any form of guarantee. Because Travel Agent is not in the air travel business, rental car business, and/or hotel business, and does not sell a particular car, air travel ticket, or hotel room, but only assists you in making reservations, you understand and acknowledge that we have no control or authority over the airline, rental car, and/or hotel, or the rates they charge, or services they provide. Any decisions regarding update, maintenance, or description of the cruise, car, and/or hotel is provided exclusively by the providers of each. Lodging providers are constantly making changes, improvements and renovations to their products. Likewise lodging providers are constantly making their rooms available for customer's use, so any deterioration in the hotel rooms is not within the control of Travel Agent. Thus Travel Agent is not in a position to comment or give any opinion regarding the appropriateness of any fees charged by the hotels. We make best efforts to keep the Site updated. However because of the nature of Travel Agent's Services, we are not in control of the quality of rooms provided by any particular hotel, at any time. Travel Agent does not guarantee the accuracy of any information on the Site nor do we make any guarantee that the lodging establishment is not undergoing any renovations.</p>

                  <h5>Method for Making Changes or Cancellations</h5>
                  <p>Travel Agent does not change or modify existing nights to reservations. You can cancel your reservation either online at our Travel Agent Site, or by calling our customer services number 800-468-3578. Select Option 1. You may add additional services to an existing reservation provided the services desired are still available, and under the terms that are available at the time of the modification. For example, adding a night to an existing reservation for a hotel room, condo, or house, can be accomplished by creating a new reservation for your requested nights.</p>
                  <p>You may be able to change your guest name, requested bed type, smoking preferences, special requests, accessibility options, room types and number of guests by contacting Travel Agent. You may be able to change your requested type of car reserved, and request special modifications to your reservation such as infant car seats and GPS services. However, please note our suppliers may impose other change and/or cancellation fees, depending on the nature of the request. Charges vary by reservation, dates and occupants, so please review your confirmation email or contact Travel Agent for details.</p>
                  <p>Each reservation is subject to the providers' cancellation policy, which varies by provider. In the case of hotels, condos, and room reservations the typical service provider usually requires notice of cancellation 24 to 72 hours prior to your arrival date. You may cancel your prepaid hotel reservation(s), but you will be charged the cancellation or change fee as stated on your confirmation receipt or indicated in the cancellation policy for the hotel. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. NOTE, some hotels charge for the entire stay. There are no refunds for no-shows or early check outs! If you intend to arrive at your hotel after the first night of your reservation, you MUST contact us prior to the commencement of the applicable cancellation policy, to prevent cancellation of your reservation and avoid any applicable fees from the hotel, condo, or room provider.</p>
                  <p>Cancellation of rental cars usually requires notice of cancellation 24 hours in advance.</p>
                  <p>Cancellation of airfare is determined by the air carrier and many reservations may not be cancelled, or if they are the airline may only issue a credit to your credit card that can only be used for future travel on the same airline and subject to their terms and conditions.</p>
                  <p>You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. As stated above some travel service providers including airlines, hotels, and car rental companies do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the cancellation / change policy for the Travel Agent Service. You agree to abide by these Terms imposed with respect to your prepaid travel reservations for any hotels, airlines, cruise lines, and car rental companies.</p>
                  <p>In the event that a hotel or service provider is unable to honor your reservation, Travel Agent will not be liable for any cost incurred due to rebooking of the flight, change of rental car, or relocation to another hotel or condo.</p>

                  <h5>Special Rates</h5>
                  <p>When available, Travel Agent may offer additional, discounted travel rates for air fare, cruises, car rental, and hotel and condo booking options as part of our services. These discounted travel rates may be referred to as, Unpublished, Opaque, Call Center Only, Tonight and or Mobile rates for airfare, rental car, cruise ship, and/or hotel and condos, are different from other rates to which you may have access as a result of your Travel Agent VIP Membership, in several important ways. For example, the name and exact address of the provider of travel services may not be shown until after payment has been made for the booking or the final price of the travel provider may not be revealed to the customer until after the transaction is completed by the customer or the special rates may have specific booking criteria, i.e. time of travel, connecting flights, length of stay, arrival dates or minimum stay restrictions. Note: Many of these bookings are nonrefundable and final and cannot be changed, refunded, exchanged, cancelled, subject to additional fees or transferred to another party. Your credit or debit card will be charged for the amount shown even if you do not use the booking. In the case of air fare, seat assignments may not be available, and you may not be seated with members of your party. In the case of cruise lines you may not have a choice of deck levels. In the case of hotels, room type will be determined by the hotel based on the number of guests provided at time of booking. All reservations are booked for stays in non-smoking rooms (subject to availability). Hotel room assignments are determined at check-in and upgrades are not available. Travel Agent VIP Members' fees for these bookings are non-refundable and are not counted as part of the 30 room nights referenced in paragraph #30 above.</p>

                  <h5>Bank and Credit or Debit Card Fees</h5>
                  <p>Some banks and credit or debit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a U.S. credit or debit card, your bank may convert the payment amount, both for the room and the membership fee charged by Travel Agent, to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means that the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for the reservation booked through Travel Agent. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit or debit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since we may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.</p>

                  <h5>MUTUAL ARBITRATION PROVISION—PLEASE READ.</h5>
                  <p>The Parties mutually agree to resolve any and all disputes between them exclusively through final and binding arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit in court (except as otherwise provided below).  However, this Mutual Arbitration Provision does not cover disputes that, as a matter of law, may not be subject to pre-dispute arbitration agreements.</p>
                  <p>Travel Agent and You expressly agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Mutual Arbitration Provision, and that the FAA shall apply to any and all disputes between the Parties, including but not limited to those arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Travel Agent’s provision of services under this Agreement, the fees charged for Travel Agent’s services, the termination of this Agreement, and all other aspects of Your relationship with Travel Agent, past or present, whether arising under federal, state, or local law. The Parties expressly agree that this Agreement shall be governed by the FAA even in the event You and/or Travel Agent are otherwise exempted from the FAA. Any disputes in this regard shall be resolved exclusively by an arbitrator. In the event, but only in the event, the arbitrator determines the FAA does not apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in Texas shall apply.</p>
                  <p>Only an arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Mutual Arbitration Provision, including without limitation any dispute concerning arbitrability. However, the preceding clause shall not apply to any dispute relating to or arising out of the Class Action Waiver and/or Representative Action Waiver—including, but not limited to, any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver and/or Representative Action is unenforceable, unconscionable, illegal, void, or voidable; any such dispute must proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction and cannot be heard or arbitrated by an arbitrator.  Moreover, all disputes relating to or arising out of the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.</p>
                  <p>BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES BETWEEN THEM AS DESCRIBED HEREIN THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AGREE THAT ALL SUCH DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY WAY OF A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.</p>
                  <ol class="roman-list">
                     <li value="i">Before commencing individual arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), the Parties must engage in a good-faith effort to resolve any claim covered by this Mutual Arbitration Provision through an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference between You and Travel Agent.  The Party initiating the claim must give notice to the other Party in writing of its, his, or her intent to initiate an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within seven days of the other Party receiving such notice.  Engaging in an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference is a condition precedent that must be fulfilled before commencing individual arbitration.  The statute of limitations shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.</li>
                     <li value="ii">Only after the Parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute through an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, and only if those efforts fail, either You or Travel Agent may initiate arbitration by notifying the other Party in writing via certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand for arbitration must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the Party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good faith calculation of the amount-in-controversy, enumerated in United States Dollars; (4) the original personal signature of the Party seeking arbitration (a digital, electronic, copied, or facsimile signature is not sufficient); and (5) the Party’s portion of the AAA filing fee.  Any request for injunctive relief or attorney fees shall not count toward the calculation of the amount in controversy unless such injunctive relief seeks the payment of money.  If the Party seeking arbitration is represented by counsel, counsel must also provide an original personal signature on the demand for arbitration (a digital, electronic, copied, or facsimile signature is not sufficient).  By signing the demand for arbitration, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that (1) the demand for arbitration is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. Any demand for arbitration by You must be delivered to Travel Agent at the following address:  c/o Arbitration Request, 3010 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1500, Dallas TX 75234.</li>
                     <li value="iii">CLASS ACTION WAIVER—PLEASE READ. Travel Agent and You mutually agree that any and all disputes or claims between the Parties will be resolved in individual arbitration. The Parties further agree that by entering into this Agreement, they waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard, administered, or arbitrated as a class, collective, or mass action, or to participate in any class, collective, and/or mass action, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class, collective, and/or mass action, or to award relief to anyone but the individual in arbitration (“Class Action Waiver”).  Travel Agent and You agree that the definition of a “class, collective, and/or mass action” includes, but is not limited to, instances in which You are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms that has filed more than 25 arbitration demands of a nearly identical nature against Travel Agent within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on Your behalf.  This Class Action Wavier does not prevent You or Travel Agent from participating in a classwide settlement of claims.</li>
                     <li value="iv">Any arbitration shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), except as follows: (1) The parties shall be required to meet and confer to select a neutral arbitrator.  If the parties are unable to mutually agree to an arbitrator, the arbitration shall be heard by one arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall be an attorney with experience in the law underlying the dispute; (2) Unless applicable law provides otherwise, as determined by the arbitrator, Travel Agent and You shall equally share filing fees and other similar and usual administrative costs, as are common to both court and administrative proceedings. Travel Agent shall pay any costs uniquely associated with arbitration, such as payment of the Arbitrator and room rental; (3) If a Party timely serves an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, or any other state-law equivalent, and the judgment that the other Party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other Party shall pay the costs, including filing fees, incurred after the offer was made; (4) Both Parties agree not to oppose or interfere with any negotiations or agreements between the other Party and AAA, a AAA administrator, or an individual arbitrator, relating to a Party’s portion of the fees.  The arbitrator, however, may disallow any private agreement between AAA or a AAA administrator, on the one hand, and the negotiating Party, on the other hand, if the arbitrator believes that the private agreement undermines his or her neutrality as arbitrator; (5) The arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third-parties) allowing the Parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each Party to prepare that Party’s claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes; (6) Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver, the arbitrator may award all remedies to which a Party is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, including but not limited to the imposition of sanctions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but shall not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have been available in a court of law for the claims presented in arbitration. The arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is applicable. Such remedies include, but are not limited to, sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11; (7) The arbitrator may hear motions to dismiss and/or motions for summary judgment. An arbitrator may not permit the filing of a motion for summary judgment until after the parties have conducted discovery to support their claims and defenses. Any motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment shall otherwise be governed by the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions; (8) The arbitrator’s decision or award shall be in writing with findings of fact and conclusions of law; (9) Any finding of bad faith in creating or submitting an arbitration demand will be deemed to violate this Agreement, and shall entitle the other Party to recover its, his, or her attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses; and (10) Either Travel Agent or You may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo, to avoid suffering irreparable harm, or on the ground that without such relief the arbitration provided in this Section may be rendered ineffectual. If at any time the arbitrator or arbitration administrator fails to enforce the terms of this Mutual Arbitration Provision, either Party may seek to enjoin the arbitration proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction, and the arbitration shall be automatically stayed pending the outcome of that proceeding.</li>
                     <li value="v">If the amount in controversy set forth in an arbitration demand is less than $10,000, either Party may elect to have the following streamlined procedures apply: the Parties shall present their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in written form without a live hearing; no Party may take more than one deposition; discovery or other information exchange shall be limited to information that is essential to fair resolution of the claim(s); and the arbitrator’s award (while still required to be in writing) need not include findings of fact or conclusions of law.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Regardless of any other terms of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement or Mutual Arbitration Provision prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Mutual Arbitration Provision. This Mutual Arbitration Provision also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on the claims addressed in this Section, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by this Mutual Arbitration Provision. Nothing in this Mutual Arbitration Provision prevents or excuses a Party from satisfying any conditions precedent and/or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law or as required under this Agreement before bringing a claim in arbitration.</p>
